“One of the greatest discoveries a man makes, one of his great surprises, is to find he can do what he was afraid he couldn’t do.”— Henry Ford

Welcome!

After years of being a data analyst, I’ve decided to pivot and focus on Identity and Access Management. Danielle Labs is a space where I’ll share what I’m learning and give you insight into my skills. So here’s to learning and growing every day!

In my free time, I’m listening to 90s Hip Hop and R&B, obsessing over podcasts or watching hair and makeup tutorials on YouTube. I’m also trying to keep with the latest trends in media.

Take some time to explore the blog, read something interesting, and feel free to reach out.
