In my last post, I demonstrated how to add a user to Entra ID. However, assigning permissions to individual users isn't typically best practice because it is time-consuming and results in access inconsistencies. These inconsistencies can lead to data breaches and security gaps. 

Therefore, it is best to create groups, assign permissions to the groups, then add users or employees to these groups. This minimizes security risks and reduces overhead. It also ensures that all users or employees within a group have consistent and appropriate permissions. 

1\. Create a Microsoft 365 Group

Microsoft 365 Groups are designed for collaboration. When this kind of group is created, it automatically provisions a suite of resources for its members. Resources include a shared mailbox and calendar in Outlook and a shared workspace in Microsoft Teams. I decided to create a group called "Project 2030".

2\. Create a Security Group

Security groups are used for access control and management. They are designed to grant permissions to resources within Microsoft 365. This make managing user access at scale a lot easier. For this example, I named my group "Guest Users".

3\. Add an existing user to the new group

I decided to add my user Laura Johnson to my Project 2030 group I created earlier.

4\. Add licenses and owners to a group

I went ahead and made Laura and myself owners of the Project 2030 group. As owners, we can manage group membership and access requests. Then, I added a Visio Plan 2 license to the group. The license gives us access to Microsoft Visio, a diagramming application.

In the real world, I'm sure that this process is automated. A company with thousands of employees could have dozens of groups! With that, I am currently working on a script that automates the creation of these groups using Powershell Graph.
